Deciding on the proper hospital or organization for appointments is usually cumbersome, given a large number of available options. To aid this decision-making, we can utilize sophisticated AI algorithms that compare corresponding data from organizations and hospitals.\n\nThis project seeks to develop an AI system that analyzes hospital or organization records and offers customized recommendations based on in-depth data analysis. Through the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain-based AI agents, the system retrieves useful insights from a hospital dataset (in CSV format) and utilizes a generative model to offer a recommendation to the user.\n\nThe system is intended to:\n1. Upload and process hospital data – The data, including satisfaction scores and performance indicators, is uploaded       into the system.\n2. Query handling – The user provides a query concerning hospital choice, e.g., asking information about the performance    of a given hospital.\n3. Data retrieval – Employing RAG, the system retrieves appropriate data from the hospital dataset to respond to the        query.\n4. Analysis and suggestion – The agent based on LangChain analyzes the data retrieved and makes a suggestion regarding      whether the user should make an appointment with the hospital or not.\n\nThis system can be useful for medical patients and institutions interested in offering tailored, data-backed recommendations to their users. Automating data processing and decision-making, the system presents a seamless, efficient means of assessing hospitals and institutions for health appointment considerations.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Technologies used:\n\n1.
